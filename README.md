# Sandbox
A place to mess around and test things out.
<br>Things like this:
*italics*, **bold**, and ~~strikthrough~~.

More specifically, its a place to test out things in different programing languages with some sort of version tracking and redundency if I lose my files. I have been using this for random tutorials and little programs I want to work on. It also gets me into using git, which I hear is kinda important...

## ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
